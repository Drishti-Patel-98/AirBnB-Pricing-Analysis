Objective: Analyzed Airbnb listings in Paris to uncover pricing trends and host activity over time, with a focus on the most expensive neighborhoods.

Key Tasks:
- Cleaned and transformed raw listing data using pandas, handling date parsing and missing values.
- Filtered down the data to only Paris Listings.
- Produced DataFrames that will be used in visualizations by aggregating and manipulating the listings data in several ways.
- Visualized the data using matplotlib and seaborn, adding custom data labels for clarity.
  1. Average price by neighborhood – Horizontal bar chart
  2. Average price by ‘accommodates’ in Paris's most expensive neighborhood –Horizontal bar chart
  3. Average price by year – Line chart
  4. New hosts by year – Line chart
  5. Dual-axis time series chart to compare the growth of new hosts and average listing prices over time using twinx() in matplotlib.
